# About
This is a drum machine. You can play different sounds by clicking the drumpads or pressing the corresponding keys (case-sensitive).
It was built with React and SASS. 

# Usage

## Option 1
Go into the `drum_machine` directory and follow the instructions. This method uses npm to start a server on localhost:3000

## Option 2
Clone the three files `App.js`, `App.css`, and `index.html`. View the html directly. The `.js` file contains JSX code which
needs preprocessing into Javascript. Use Babel for such preprocessing.
